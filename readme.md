title: "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on e-Commerce Transaction Data"
project_overview: |
  This project involves conducting **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail company. 
  The dataset contains valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior, including information such as product details, sales, countries, and customer activities. 
  Our aim is to uncover important trends, patterns, and statistics through analysis and visualization.

  Dataset Size: The dataset is **500,000 rows** long, containing extensive transactional data over a one-year period. 
  This large dataset allows for comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and purchasing trends.

what_is_EDA: |
  EDA stands for **Exploratory Data Analysis**. It is a crucial process in data analysis that involves:
    - Understanding the data through statistical summary and visualization.
    - Identifying patterns in the dataset, including trends, correlations, and anomalies.
    - Summarizing the dataset using graphical tools like histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
    
  By using EDA, we gain insights that help drive business decisions, reveal hidden patterns, and guide further analysis.
